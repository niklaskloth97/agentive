        Welcome to the AGENTIVE platform! As part of an EU-funded Erasmus+ initiative, we are creating innovative tools to promote language learning in Early Childhood Education (ECE). We empower children and foster professional development of educators. Our mission is to  provide accessible, open-source materials for language and literacy development, offer professional development training and stimulate school-university-business synergies.

          Welcome to the AGENTIVE platform! As part of an EU-funded Erasmus+ initiative, we are creating innovative tools to promote language learning in Early Childhood Education (ECE). Our goal is to provide free evidence-based resources for language and literacy development in ECE, create professional development materials for teachers and stimulate school-university-business synergies.

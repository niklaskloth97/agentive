This consortium fosters synergies between academia and schools to create innovative multilingual education material. The collaboration is designed to ensure sustainable and impactful results that benefit teachers, students, parents and society as a whole." />
      <SectionWithIcon icon={<FaGlobeEurope />} title="Addressing a Multilingual Europe" description="In regions like Luxembourg, Switzerland, Tyrol and Primorska, multiple languages are spoken side by side and children may learn two societal languages from an early age through daily interactions or language learning in preschool. Additionally, migration patterns across Europe have increased the language diversity in societies and classrooms. Programmes for language awareness and early English thrive. AGENTIVE addresses these realities by developing inclusive and accessible, multilingual learning materials that are adaptable to different cultural and linguistic contexts." />
      <SectionWithIcon icon={<FaBookOpen />} title="Open Access to Resources" description="One of AGENTIVEâ€™s core principles is openness. All educational materials developed through the project will be freely accessible, ensuring that teachers, schools, and parents can integrate them directly into their practice. The digital resources are designed to be flexible and modular, enabling educators to tailor them to the needs of their pupils, the curricular constraints and the specificities of the countries." />

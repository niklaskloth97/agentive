                Languages play an important role in children&apos;s everyday lives in Europe; many speak
                several languages at home while also encountering further languages at school. Many European
                countries have introduced elements of multilingual education in Early Childhood Education
                (ECE). One such approach is translanguaging, a rich and child-friendly method of
                multilingualism, through which children can learn from their full language repertoires
                irrespective of language input and learning conditions. When children see their languages
                reflected in educational resources, feel understood and heard, and have access to books and
                stories in languages they understand and care about, teachers appear more at ease and
                confident to foster language learning as they lack multilingual resources.

            AGENTIVE seeks to bridge this gap by providing multilingual evidence-based resources that
            support literacy development in multiple languages and are easily adapted to various cultural
            and linguistic contexts. Professionals and parents can download our eight pedagogical sets
            (i.e., stories and follow-up activities) on our digital platform. AGENTIVE also offers
            seminars for student teachers and professional development courses for teachers to develop the
            digital and pedagogical competences required to use our materials effectively. Our
            school-university-business synergy will see to the wide dissemination of the findings.

            The AGENTIVE project is a groundbreaking initiative funded by the Erasmus+ programme of the European Union. Uniting universities and organizations from six countries, this pan-European partnership endorses the EU's commitment to linguistic diversity, inclusion and digital transformation in education.
            Led by Prof. Dr. Claudine Kirsch, AGENTIVE brings together the University of Luxembourg, the University of MÃ¼nster (Germany), the Free University of Bozen (Italy), the University of Teacher Education of the Grisons (Switzerland), the University of Primorska (Slovenia), and Web2Learn (Greece). 
            In regions like Luxembourg, Switzerland, Tyrol and Primorska, multiple languages are spoken side by side and children may learn two societal languages from an early age through daily interactions or language learning in preschool. Additionally, migration patterns across Europe have increased the language diversity in societies and classrooms. Programmes for language awareness and early English thrive. AGENTIVE addresses these realities. 
            Our synergies between academia and schools enable us to develop innovative pedagogies and evidence-based and sustainable multilingual learning materials that benefit teachers, children, and parents.

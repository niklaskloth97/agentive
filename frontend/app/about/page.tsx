          <h2 className="text-m font-semibold mb-2">Our Vision: Promoting Multilingualism in ECE</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-white mb-4">
          Languages play an important role in children’s everyday lives in Europe; many speak several languages at home while also encountering further languages at school. Due to the cognitive, social, and academic benefits of multilingualism, many European countries have introduced multilingual education in Early Childhood Education (ECE). Indeed, children can learn languages successfully early in life provided they have child-friendly and stimulating conditions. While programmes for language awareness and early English thrive, teachers appear to be unsure of how to foster language learning and to lack multilingual resources. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-white mb-4">
          AGENTIVE seeks to bridge this gap by providing multilingual evidence-based resources that support multilingual literacy development and are easily adaptable to various cultural and linguistic contexts. Professionals and parents can download our  
          eight pedagogical sets (i.e., stories and follow-up activities) on our digital platform. AGENTIVE also offers seminars for student teachers and professional development courses for teachers to develop the digital and pedagogical competences needed to use our materials effectively. Our school-university-business synergy will contribute to the wide dissemination of the findings. 
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-m font-semibold mb-2">An EU-Funded Erasmus+ Initiative Across Sectors</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-white mb-4">
          The AGENTIVE project is a groundbreaking initiative funded by the Erasmus+ programme of the European Union. Uniting universities and organizations from six countries, this pan-European partnership endorses the EU’s commitment to linguistic diversity, inclusion and digital transformation in education.  
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-white mb-4">
          In regions like Luxembourg, Switzerland, Tyrol and Primorska, multiple languages are spoken side by side and children may learn two societal languages from an early age through daily interactions or language learning in preschool. Additionally, migration patterns across Europe have increased the language diversity in societies and classrooms. Programmes for language awareness and early English thrive. AGENTIVE addresses these realities by developing inclusive and accessible, multilingual learning materials that are adaptable to different cultural and linguistic contexts. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-white mb-4">
          Led by Prof. Dr. Claudine Kirsch, AGENTIVE brings together the University of Luxembourg, the University of Münster (Germany), the Free University of Bolzano (Italy), the University of Teacher Education of the Grisons (Switzerland), the University of Primorska (Slovenia) and Web2Learn (Greece). Our synergies between academia and schools enable us to to create innovative, evidence-based and sustainable multilingual education resources that benefit teachers, student teachers, parents, children and society as a whole. 
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-m font-semibold mb-2">Open Access to Resources</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-white mb-4">
          One of AGENTIVE’s core principles is openness. All educational materials developed through the project will be freely accessible, ensuring that teachers, schools, and parents can integrate them directly into their practice. The digital resources are designed to be flexible and modular, enabling educators to tailor them to the needs of their pupils, the curricular constraints and the specificities of the countries. 
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-m font-semibold mb-2">Objectives of the Project</h2>
          <p className='text-gray-600 dark:text-white mb-1'>AGENTIVE is guided by two key objectives:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal ml-8 text-gray-600 dark:text-white mb-4">
            <li>
            Enhance digital transformation of schools and universities through open education resources and state-of-the-art pedagogies: By creating open-access, innovative pedagogical tools, the project supports the digital readiness of schools and universities. Training programs for pre- and in-service ECE teachers are integral to this goal. 
            </li>
            <li>
            Leverage open, multilingual and cross-sectoral ECE through university-school-business synergies: AGENTIVE fosters partnerships between schools, universities, and businesses to innovate multilingual education. These collaborations ensure that our pedagogical approaches and materials are appropriate, inclusive and forward-thinking.
